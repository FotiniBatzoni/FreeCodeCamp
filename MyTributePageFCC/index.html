                <b>Early life and education</b>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Sapolsky was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrants from the Soviet Union. His father, Thomas
                    Sapolsky, was an architect who renovated the restaurants Lüchow's and Lundy's.<br>
                    Robert was raised an Orthodox Jew and spent his time reading about and imagining living with
                    silverback gorillas. By age 12, he was writing fan letters to primatologists. <br>
                    He attended John Dewey High School and, by that time, he was reading textbooks on the subject and
                    teaching himself Swahili.

                <b>Career</b>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Sapolsky is currently the John A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Professor at Stanford University, holding
                    joint appointments in several departments, including Biological Sciences, Neurology & Neurological
                    Sciences,
                    and Neurosurgery.

                <p>
                    As a neuroendocrinologist, he has focused his research on issues of stress and neuronal degeneration, as
                    well as on the possibilities of gene therapy strategies for protecting susceptible neurons from disease.
                    Currently, he is working on gene transfer techniques to strengthen neurons against the disabling effects
                    of glucocorticoids.[citation needed]

                    Each year, Sapolsky spends time in Kenya studying a population of wild baboons in order to identify
                    the sources of stress in their environment, and the relationship between personality and patterns of
                    stress-related disease in these animals. More specifically, Sapolsky studies the cortisol levels
                    between the alpha male and female and the subordinates to determine stress level. An early but still
                    relevant example of his studies of olive baboons is to be found in his 1990 Scientific American
                    article, "Stress in the Wild".[18] He has also written about neurological impairment and the
                    insanity
                    defense within the American legal system.

                    Sapolsky's work has been featured widely in the press, most notably in the National Geographic
                    documentary Stress: Portrait of a Killer, articles in The New York Times, Wired magazine, the
                    Stanford magazine,
                    and The Tehran Times. His speaking style (e.g., on Radiolab, The Joe Rogan Experience, and his
                    Stanford human behavioural biology lectures) has garnered attention.

                    Sapolsky's specialization in primatology and neuroscience has made him prominent in the public
                    discussion of mental health—and, more broadly, human relationships—from an evolutionary context.

                    Sapolsky has received numerous honors and awards for his work, including the prestigious MacArthur
                    Fellowship Genius Grant in 1987, an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, and the Klingenstein Fellowship
                    in Neuroscience. He was also awarded the National Science Foundation Presidential Young
                    Investigator Award, the Young Investigator of the Year Awards from the Society for Neuroscience,
                    the International Society for Psychoneuroendocrinology, and the Biological Psychiatry Society.

                    In 2007 he received the John P. McGovern Award for Behavioral Science, awarded by the American
                    Association for the Advancement of Science.

                    In 2008 he received Wonderfest's Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization.In February 2010
                    Sapolsky was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished
                    achievers, following the earlier Emperor Has No Clothes Award for year 2002.

                    Sapolsky is married to Lisa Sapolsky, a doctor in neuropsychology. They have two children, Benjamin
                    and Rachel.
